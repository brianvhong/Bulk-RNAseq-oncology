# RNAseq-oncology
Bulk RNAseq analysis for oncology pilot study: Data analysis and visualizations. Treatment conditions are hidden until work is published in a peer-reviewed journal.

# Brief Method Design: 

- Mice (n = 6) were treated under two conditions: control (n = 3) and treatment 1 (n = 3) for x length of time.

- X Tissue was harvested for Bulk RNAseq analysis.

- QC/gene alignment/gene annotation were all conducted on Galaxy.

- QC, Data analysis, and visualizations were all conducted on R.
